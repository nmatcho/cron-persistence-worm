## Overview
A huge network activity spike at midnight on October 20 launched a threat hunting campaign to uncover the cause. During the investigation of Microsoft Sentinel data sources, a Linux virtual machine named compromised-linux-vm (NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY) was identified exhibiting **high-volume outbound SSH scanning behavior** and evidence of **malicious script execution** within `/dev/shm` ‚Äî a volatile memory-based directory often abused by attackers.  

The investigation uncovered:
- 400K+ network events to AWS IP ranges.
- Over 50K invocations of a suspicious binary (`/dev/shm/astats -scan ssh 1 az`).
- Malicious Bash and cron scripts establishing persistence.
- Sentinel alerts for **lateral movement**, suggesting worm-like propagation.

The VM was confirmed **compromised** and isolated for further analysis. The malware in question was later determined to be used for cryptomining and was propagated onto the VM via misconfigurations, which included visibility on the public internet and a lack of brute force protection on the Ubuntu server's root account.

---

## Initial Discovery

**Data Source:** `AzureNetworkAnalyticsIPDetails_CL`  
**Initial Query:**
```kql
AzureNetworkAnalyticsIPDetails_CL
| where PublicIPDetails_s == "amazon data services Ireland limited"
| summarize WhatIsGoingOn = count()
````

**Result:**

* 441,090 interactions with **Amazon Data Services Ireland Limited** within 24 hours.

**Interpretation:**
Unusual volume of outbound connections suggested command-and-control (C2) or scanning behavior.
Further investigation was warranted.

---

## Investigation Steps

### First Glance

Focused on IPs beginning with `34.243` (AWS Ireland range).
Queried the **DeviceNetworkEvents** table for correlation.

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteIP contains "34.243"
```

Identified consistent interactions from:

```
compromised-linux-vm
```

Discovered repeated executions of:

```
/dev/shm/astats -scan ssh 1 az
```

---

### Second Glance

Expanded query to confirm scale and timeline:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteIP contains "34.243"
| where DeviceName == "compromised-linux-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "/dev/shm/astats -scan ssh 1 az"
| summarize WhatIsGoingOn = count()
```

**ChatGPT analysis summary:**

* `/dev/shm` use indicates in-memory stealth.
* `-scan ssh` implies network reconnaissance.
* Behavior consistent with malware performing **SSH brute-force propagation**.

**Count:** 6,434 executions.

---

### Expanded Search

Querying a broader IP range (`34.24`) revealed:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteIP contains "34.24"
| where DeviceName == "compromised-linux-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "/dev/shm/astats -scan ssh 1 az"
| summarize WhatIsGoingOn = count()
```

**Count:** 52,522 executions in 24 hours.

---

## File System Investigation

Queried **DeviceFileEvents** to identify file operations:

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "compromised-linux-vm"
| project TimeGenerated, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

### Exhibit A

```bash
bash -c 'cd "/dev/shm" && if [ ! -f "w.sh" ]; then cat > "w.sh" && chmod +x w.sh; fi'
```

**Analysis:**

* Creates `/dev/shm/w.sh` in memory.
* Indicates script delivery (possibly downloaded via pipe).
* Classic malware staging behavior.

### Exhibit B

```bash
crontab -
```

**Analysis:**

* Likely writes malicious cron jobs via stdin.
* Used for persistence ‚Äî common in Linux malware.

### Exhibit C

```bash
bash -c '
PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
CRON="$(crontab -l 2>/dev/null || true)"
if ! echo "$CRON" | grep -F '/dev/shm/w.sh "astats" "netai" "kstats" "ssh 1 az"' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  (echo "$CRON"; echo '@reboot  /dev/shm/w.sh "astats" "netai" "kstats" "ssh 1 az"'; echo '0 * * * * cd "/dev/shm" && ./w.sh "astats" "netai" "kstats" "ssh 1 az"') | crontab -
fi
'
```

**Analysis:**

* Confirms **persistence setup** via cron.
* Ensures `w.sh` executes hourly and at reboot.
* Typical self-replication logic used in worms.

### Exhibit D

```bash
bash -c "ps aux | grep astats | grep -v grep | wc -l"
```

**Analysis:**

* Counts running `astats` processes.
* Likely used by malware to prevent duplicate instances.

## Malicious Behavior Analysis

| Indicator                                  | Description                                         | Severity     |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `/dev/shm/astats -scan ssh`                | SSH port scanning tool or worm module               | **Critical** |
| `/dev/shm/w.sh`                            | Malicious script staging/persistence                | **High**     |
| `crontab -`                                | Persistence mechanism                               | **High**     |
| `/usr/bin/apt-key --readonly verify`       | Possibly used by system processes; context required | **Medium**   |
| Repeated network events to AWS Ireland IPs | External scanning / lateral spread                  | **Critical** |

**Behavior Summary:**

* Worm-like SSH scanning.
* Cron-based persistence.
* In-memory execution (avoids disk logs).
* Likely spreading to other VMs over the same network.

---

## Lateral Movement and Worm Indicators

Microsoft Sentinel generated **Lateral Movement** alerts for the same VM.

This aligns with:

* SSH scan targets (`-scan ssh 1 az`)
* Hourly cron-based re-execution
* Potential credential reuse attempts across internal Azure network

---

## Response Actions

1. **Isolated the VM** in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to prevent further spread.
2. **Ran malware scans** to verify infection scope.
3. **Correlated Defender alerts** to confirm lateral movement behavior.
4. **Communicated with VM owner** ‚Äî confirmed owner was active during event but unaware of `astats` activity.
5. **Documented and preserved evidence** (screenshots, queries, command logs).
6. **Escalated to Senior Engineer for Further Investigation** - Senior engineer determined the script to be cryptomining software and identified the root cause misconfigurations.

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Root Cause**        | Ubuntu VM was misconfigured to be internet facing w/o brute force protection |

| **Persistence**       | Cron jobs calling `/dev/shm/w.sh`                                            |
| **Propagation**       | SSH scanning across network and public IP ranges                             |
| **Detection Sources** | `DeviceNetworkEvents`, `DeviceFileEvents`, Microsoft Sentinel Alerts         |
| **Impact**            | Network noise, Confirmed no spread to other VMs                              |
| **Status**            | Incident Escalated, Root Cause Identified and Remediated, Incident Closed    |

## Lessons Learned

* `/dev/shm` is a critical directory to monitor on Linux systems.
* Persistent cron entries often reveal post-exploitation activity.
* High-frequency outbound SSH traffic should always trigger investigation.
* Ensure test VMs have proper network segmentation to prevent public exposure.
* Manual threat hunting can reveal incidents **before alerts fully trigger**.
